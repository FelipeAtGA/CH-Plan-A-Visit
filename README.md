Application briefing
-------------------------------------

Visitor Planner is an application to facilitate and enhance a museum visitor's experience by allowing them to program their visit ahead of time.

The application provides the user with means to query the museum's current exhibitions and artworks in view so that they can select specific items from the query result and add them to a list planner. From this list planner, the user keep track of the items she/he means to see during the visit to the museum, allowing them to have a more meaningful experience.

This list of all selected artworks displays an image and the title of the art piece, along with delete and view single items functionalities for a more flexible and personalized record tracking. The view single functionality displays an image, a description, and a field to write personal memos/notes about the experience, the artwork specifications, or any other information.

This application is in development phase, and the project is part of the WDI curriculum requirements for the GA/NYC-TTP fellowship. Technologies used are node, express, and react.
